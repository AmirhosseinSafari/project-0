# Project 0
<hr></hr>

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript:

This is my project 0, and it is about my hobbies, some few of my skills, and a little of my education information. My project has 4 HTML files, and they are in separate folders. Each folder contains an HTML file, an SCSS file, and two CSS files that are generated by the SASS command in the terminal. Every page has navbar in the top that is sticky there and its footer. 

1. In `assets`, I put photos that I used in it. 
2. The `Education` folder contains my education page. I used the bootstrap grid layout for it. 
3. The `Home` folder contains my home page. 
4. In the `Interest` folder, I used the table layout of bootstrap in it. 
5. In the `skills` page, I used bootstrap cards in it.

Hope you enjoy reading it.
